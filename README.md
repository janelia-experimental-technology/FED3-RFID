This repo contains all the files necessary to integrate RFID with the Feeding Experimentation Device version 3 (FED3), originally developed by KravitzLabDevices.
This reader is compatible with FDX-B 134.2 kHz ISO 11784/85 transponders; the firmware was specifically developed to log both ID and temperature using the Biothem 13 Pit tags: https://www.biomark.com/product/biotherm13-pit-tag/
It is advised to disconnect the battery from the FED3 board when not in use; about 18mA is drawn from the battery even when the FED3 is powered down.
