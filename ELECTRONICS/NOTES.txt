Refer to schematic, photos, and parts list for build.
In order to fit all electronics within the housing, short headers (male and female) should be used to limit height.
A 2mm JST connector can be used to connect the boost converter to the battery output from the Adafruit Feather M0.
A 2N4401 NPN BJT transistor was used, but a 2N2222 or similar would work just as well; be sure to adjust resistor value as needed.
It is advised to disconnect the battery from the FED3 board when not in use, ~18mA is drawn from the battery even when the FED3 is powered down.
